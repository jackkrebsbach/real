1. Let $S$ be a non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above and let $\beta=\sup S$. Suppose that $\beta \notin S$. Prove that for each $\epsilon>0$, the set $\{x \in S: x>\beta-\epsilon\}$ is infinite.
}

\sol
\begin{myproof}
    
Assume, by way of contradiction, that $(\beta - \epsilon, \beta)$ is finite. Then we have that $(\beta - \epsilon,\beta) \sim \NN_{N}$ where $N \in \NN.$ Consider the value $$\frac{\beta - \epsilon}{2N}.$$ This partitions the interval $(\beta - \epsilon, \beta)$ into $2N$ bins. 

Next, we take the collection $\{ \beta - \epsilon + \frac{\beta - \epsilon}{2N^\star}  \colon  N^\star \in \NN_N\}.$ We can start listing off elements of this set until we terminate at $N^\star = N,$ which is $ \beta - \epsilon + \frac{\beta-\epsilon}{2N}$.\par However, $$N + 1 \not\in \NN_N$$ but 
$$ \beta - \epsilon + \frac{\beta - \epsilon}{2(N+1)} \in (\beta - \epsilon, \epsilon).$$

By pigeon hole principle $|(\beta-\epsilon, \beta)| \neq |\NN_N|.$ Thus, the set $\{x \in S: x>\beta-\epsilon\}$ is infinite.

2. Prove that the union of a countable set and an uncountable set is uncountable.
}
\begin{myproof}
  Assume, by way of contradiction, that the union of a countable set $A$ and a uncountable set $B$ is countable. Then, $A \cup B$ is countable. By Theorem 1.5.7, then $B \subset A \cup B$ is countable or finite \contra. Thus, $A \cup B$ must be uncountable.

3. Exercise 1.5.4:
}

(a) Show $|(a, b)|=|\mathbb{R}|$. 


\sol
$$
f(x) = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{b-a}\left[x - \frac{a+b}{2}\right]\right)
$$
We have domain $f$ is $(a,b)$, the range is $(-\infty, \infty) = \RR$ . The function $f$ is both onto and 1-1. Thus, $(a,b) \sim \RR.$

\par \bigskip
(b) Show that an unbounded interval like $(a, \infty)=\{x: x>a\}$ has the same cardinality at $\mathbb{R}$ as well.

\sol
$$
f(x)=log(x-a)
$$

\par \bigskip
(c) Show that $[0,1)$ has the same cardinality as $(0,1)$. 



\sol


$$ f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
    \frac{1}{2} & x= 0 \\
    \frac{x}{2} &  x \in \{ \frac{1}{2^n} \colon n \in \NN \} \\
    x & else

 (a) Give an example of a countable collection of disjoint open intervals.
\par \bigskip

$A=\{(a_n,a_n+1): n \in \NN\} = \{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),\dots,(a_n,a_n+1)\}$

$$
f \colon \NN \rightarrow A 
$$ $$ f(n)= (n, n+1)$$
\par \bigskip

 (b) Give an example of an uncountable collection of disjoint open intervals, or argue that no such collection exists.


No such collection exists.

\begin{myproof}
    
Let $X$ be a collection of disjoint intervals. For each $x \in X$ denote $x = (a_i, b_i)$ where $i \in \NN.$ Because each interval is open they must contain at least two real numbers. By the density of $\QQ$ in $\RR$ we know that there exists $q_i \in \QQ$ such that $a_i < q_i < b_i.$Thus we obtain a new set of rational numbers, $Y$. Note that while each $a_i, b_i$ may not be unique between intervals, each $r_i$ is. Combining Theorem 1.5.6 ($\QQ$ is countable) and Theorem 1.5.7 (A subset of a countable set is either countable or finite) $Y$ must be countable. Hence, any collection of disjoint open intervals is countable.

\end{myproof}

5. ChatGPT Challenge: Find an example of a sequence of closed bounded intervals $I_1, I_2, \ldots$ with the property that $\bigcap_{k=1}^n I_k \neq \emptyset$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, but $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n=\emptyset$
}

Proof: Let $I_n=\left[\frac{1}{n}, 1-\frac{1}{n}\right]$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
For each natural number $n$, the interval $I_n$ is a closed bounded interval, and their intersection is non-empty:
$$
\bigcap_{k=1}^n I_k=\left[\frac{1}{n}, 1-\frac{1}{n}\right] \neq \emptyset
$$
\textbf{
  Your proposition seems reasonable at first but be careful with your intervals. When $k=1$, we have $I_k = \left[1,0 \right]$ which is the empty set. Thus, any intersection after that must be the empty set and your example does not hold.}
  \par
  \textbf{You may consider $\mathbf{I_n=\left[\frac{1}{n+1}, 1-\frac{1}{n+1} \right]}$, but you still have problems. The next interval is $\mathbf{\left[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right]}$, and every interval after that is a superset of this - the infinite intersection can not be the empty set.
}
\par\bigskip
However, when we consider the infinite intersection:
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n=\emptyset
$$
The infinite intersection is empty because as $n$ approaches infinity, the left endpoint $\frac{1}{n}$ approaches zero, and the right endpoint $1-\frac{1}{n}$ approaches 1 . 

\par
\textbf{
Even if we consider my suggested intervals, this is still false. We have that  $$\mathbf{ \frac{1}{2} \in  \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n}.$$ Make sure to do some sanity checks while you are going through examples. Make it concrete. Your logic does not hold. 
}

So, the infinite intersection becomes the empty set.
