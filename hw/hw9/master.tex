Let $g: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=0$.

(a) Show that $\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x) g(x)=0$ for any function $g$ as above IS NOT TRUE.

(b) Assume that $g$ is a bounded function on $A$. Show that $\lim _{x \rightarrow c} g(x) f(x)=0$.

Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers with $a \neq 0$. Use the definition of continuity to prove that the function $f$ defined by $f(x)=a x+b$ is continuous at every real number.
}

\begin{myproof}
    Let $\epsilon >0$ and $c \in \RR.$ Choose $\delta = \epsilon/a.$ If we have $ |x-c|< \delta$ it follows $$ |f(x) - f(c)| = |ax +b - (ac+b)| = | ax + b -ac - b | = |ax -ac| = |a(x-c)| < |a \frac{\epsilon}{a} | < \epsilon.$$

Thus, $f(x)=a x+b$ is continuous at every real number.
\end{myproof}

\qs{}{
 Use the definition of limit to prove that $\lim _{x \rightarrow c} x^2=c^2$ for every real number $c$.
}

\begin{myproof}
  Let $\epsilon > 0.$ Choose $\delta = \min\{1, \epsilon/(2c+1)\}$. If we have $0 < |x-c| < \delta$ it follows that, $$|f(x) - L| = |x^2 - c^2| = |x + c||x-c| < (2c+1)\frac{\epsilon}{2c+1} = \epsilon$$.

Thus, $\lim _{x \rightarrow c} x^2=c^2$ for every real number $c$.

Find constants $a$ and $b$ so that the function $f$ defined by
$$
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
3 a x^2+1 & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
a x+b & 1<x<2 \\

First we find constants $a$ and $b$ so that $f(x)$ has a limit defined at each point $[0,4].$ Plugging in $1$ and $2$ in each of the equations defined in the piecewise function $f(x)$ yields a system of equations:$$ 2a +1 = a + b \implies 2a +1 = b$$
and $$2a +b = 4b + a \implies a = 3b.$$

Substituting $a = 3b$ into the first equation yields $$2(3b) = b \implies 6b + 1 =6 \implies 5b = -1 \implies b = \frac{-1}{5}.$$ Finally, solving for $a = 3b = 3 (-1/5) = -3/5.$ Thus, $$ b = \frac{-1}{5} \text { and } a = \frac{-3}{5} $$ and $f$ becomes


$$
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
-9/5 x^2+1 & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
-3/5 x - 1/5 & 1<x<2 \\
-2/5 x - 3/5 & 2 \leq x \leq 4
\end{array}\right.

CHAT GPT CHALLENGE:
Let $f:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function on $[a, b]$, and suppose that $f(x)=0$ for each rational number $x$ in $[a, b]$. We aim to show that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \in[a, b]$.
}

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists $c \in[a, b]$ such that $f(c) \neq 0$. Since $f$ is continuous, for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x \in[a, b]$, if $|x-c|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(c)|<\epsilon$.

Consider the case when $\epsilon=|f(c)|$. By continuity, there exists $\delta>0$ such that for all $x \in[a, b]$, if $|x-c|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(c)|<|f(c)|$. This implies
$$
-f(c)<f(x)-f(c)<f(c) .
$$

Adding $f(c)$ to all parts of the inequality yields $0<f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $(c-\delta, c) \cap[a, b]$. Similarly, subtracting $f(c)$ from all parts of the inequality yields $f(x)<0$ for $x$ in the interval $(c, c+\delta) \cap[a, b]$. Now, consider the set of rational numbers in $[a, b]$. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist rational numbers in both $(c-\delta, c) \cap[a, b]$ and $(c, c+\delta) \cap[a, b]$. However, we have shown that for any rational $x$ in these intervals, $f(x)$ has opposite signs, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, our assumption that there exists $c$ such that $f(c) \neq 0$ is false, and we conclude that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \in[a, b]$.
